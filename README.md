# Exercises

A collection of solutions for coding exercises found on sites like [Codewars](https://codewars.com).

Every exercise directory contains `[exercise].js` and `[exercise].test.js` files. Sometimes an `[exercise].md` is included with a summary of the problem statement, what I learned, and other solutions that I appreciated if I found the exercise to be particularly insightful.

## Environment

All exercises are tested with [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com) which is configured to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io). While working through exercises, I use [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com) which displays the runtime values inline within my editor.

## Motivations

- Problem solving is fun.
- There is often always something to learn.
- After discovering my own solution, seeing alternatives can help me identify faults in my approach.
